# DreamMileActivityTracker

This tracker project is intended to help create a rankings system for one of Vibha's biggest fundraising events of the year, the Vibha Dream Mile. The Vibha Dream Mile is an event in September where people register for a race near the Atlanta area. However, in 2020, due to the Covid pandemic, that wasn't feasible. So, instead Vibha did a month long challenge where attendees have to meet month long goals of 50 miles, 100 miles, 5,000 steps/day, etc. In order to allow others to compete together, this tracker app allows participants to connect their fitbits and track their steps and allows for a ranking system to show the leaders in all the categories.
